# OpenDEP Compute
Dielectrophoresis (DEP) experiments conversion to spectra / spectra fitting software. With this software you can convert sets of images 
obtained manualy or with OpenDEP Control and fitting the obtained DEP spectra with one of the two implemented functions: Homogenous particle
or single-shell. 

It is a part of OpenDEP project, and one of the three programs developed: 
1. [OpenDEP Compute](https://github.com/IoanTivig/OpenDEP) (for spectra fitting and data conversion)
2. [OpenDEP Control](https://github.com/IoanTivig/OpenDEP_Control) (for experiments automation and control of machines)
3. OpenDEP View (for visualization of spectra and spectra generation based on parameters) - still in early stages of development

Published under GNU GPL v3.0 license.
